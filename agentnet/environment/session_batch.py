class SessionBatchEnvironment(BaseEnvironment, BaseObjective):
    """
    A generic pseudo-environment that replays sessions defined on creation by theano expressions
    ignoring agent actions completely.

    The environment takes symbolic expression for sessions represented as (.observations, .actions, .rewards)
    Unlike SessionPoolEnvironment, this one does not store it's own pool of sessions.

    To create experience-replay sessions, call Agent.get_sessions with this as an environment.

    :param observations: a tensor or a list of tensors matching agent observation sequence [batch, tick, whatever]
    :type observations: theano tensor or a list of such
    :param single observation shapes: shapes of one-tick one-batch-item observations.
                            E.g. if lasagne shape is [None, 25(ticks), 3,210,160],
                            than single_observation_shapes must contain [3,210,160]
    :type single_observation_shapes: a list of tuples of integers
    :param actions: a tensor or a list of tensors matching agent actions sequence [batch, tick, whatever]
    :type actions: theano tensor or a list of such
    :param single action shapes: shapes of one-tick one-batch-item actions. Similar to observations.
                                    All scalar means that each action has shape (,),
                                    lasagne sequence layer being of shape (None, seq_length)
    :type single_observation_shapes: a list of tuples of integers
    :param rewards: a tensor matching agent rewards sequence [batch, tick]
    :type rewards: theano tensor

    :param is_alive: whether or not session has still not finished by a particular tick. Always alive by default.
    :type is_alive: theano tensor or None
    :param preceding_agent_memory: a tensor or a list of such storing what was in agent's memory prior
                                    to the first tick of the replay session.
    :type actions: theano tensor or a list of such





    how does it tick:

    During experience replay sessions,
     - observations, actions and rewards match original ones
     - agent memory states, Q-values and all in-agent expressions (but for actions) will correspond to what
       agent thinks NOW about the replay (not what it thought when he commited actions)
     - preceding_agent_memory [optional] - what was agent's memory state prior to the first tick of the replay session.


    Although it is possible to get rewards via the regular functions, it is usually faster to take self.rewards as rewards
    with no additional computation.
